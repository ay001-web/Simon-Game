# 🎮 Simon Game

A browser-based implementation of the classic **Simon memory game**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project tests and improves pattern recognition skills through interactive gameplay, sounds, and progressive difficulty.

🔗 **Live Demo:** https://ay001-web.github.io/Simon-Game/

## 📌 Overview

The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players must repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors and sounds.  
Each correct round adds a new step to the pattern, making the game more challenging as it progresses.

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals of **frontend development**, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

-  Interactive and responsive UI.  
-  Sound effects for each button. 
-  Progressive difficulty with level tracking.  
-  Keyboard-based game start.  
-  Game-over feedback with reset functionality.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structure of the game  
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling
